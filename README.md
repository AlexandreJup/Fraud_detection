# Fraud_detection
Date : August 2024

Fraud detection in banking is a well known subject, where the goal is to detect fraudulent transactions or operations.

For this project, I worked on the base version of the NeurIPS 2022 dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022).


The goal was to complete a full training pipeline for two different methods, from data analysis to model testing, in a limited time constraint of 5 hours.
